    "\n",
    "In the last notebook, we used HuBERT layers to predict the PQ Representation of the audio clips in the Perceptual Voice Qualities Database (PVQD). We used a naive aggregation technique to do this (simply averaging over the time steps), but what if instead we decided to try and take advantage of the temporal information to perform prediction? \n",
    "\n",
    "We may *want* to use deep neural networks, because they are super duper cool and powerful, but we have to ask if it is the best tool for the job. Given that the PQ Representation is a vector that represents speaker identity, which can be thought of as the time-invariant characteristics of speech (mostly), will the temporal information increase predictive performance?
